FlatFX

A pack of geometry-based effects for your 2D Unity projects.

Online manual: http://ax23w4.com/devlog/flatfx

To start using FlatFXjust click Game Object > Effects > FlatFX in Unity's main menu. Or do the 
same by right-clicking the Hierarchy panel. This will add a new FlatFX object at 0,0,0 of your 
scene. You can place it wherever you want on X and Y axes - when you spawn new effect, you'll 
set the coordinates for them in Vector2 form. Z-position of the effects will be taken from 
object's position. Here's an example code to add an effect to your scene:

flatfx.AddEffect(Vector2.zero,0);
